stressMemory.R is a script that uses the *.csv datafiles to analyse the data and make the figures.

stressMemory_fvfm.R is a script that uses the *.csv datafiles to analyse the Fv/Fm data and make the figures.

stressMemory_dhd.R is a script that uses the *.csv datafiles to analyse and plot the priming dhd v. timepoint 1 response variables and the priming dhd v. timepoint 3 response variables.

temperatureData.xlsx contains all temperature data for the priming experiment (-4 days to day 11; tab labeled 'priming') and the preliminary experiment for determination of the standardized bleaching exposure (tab labeled 'bleaching BD50'), as well as the figures.
